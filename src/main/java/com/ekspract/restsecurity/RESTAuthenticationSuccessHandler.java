/**
 * Spring Security then invokes our specified authentication success handler.
 * This is where Spring Security would clear the authentication attributes,
 * apply some redirection strategy to a defined target URL and even retrieve a
 * cached request to submit it (so that after a successful login the system
 * re-submits the request that triggered the redirection to an authentication
 * page; in other words, it allows resuming the flow that was interrupted by a
 * login request).
 * 
 * But, once again, weâ€™re dealing with web services here so we only want the
 * server to respond with a 200 HTTP status that the login was successful.
